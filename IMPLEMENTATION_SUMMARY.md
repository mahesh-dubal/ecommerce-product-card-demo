# Implementation Summary

## Layout Approach

I implemented a **mobile-first responsive design** using CSS Grid for the Product Card component. The layout automatically adapts from a single column on mobile devices to multiple columns on larger screens, ensuring optimal viewing across all device sizes. The design focuses on clean, minimal aesthetics with clear visual hierarchy - product images are prominently displayed, followed by essential information (title, price, variants) and clear call-to-action buttons. I used a card-based layout with subtle shadows and hover effects to create depth and interactivity.

## Responsiveness Considerations

The component uses **CSS Grid with auto-fill columns** that dynamically adjust based on available space. On mobile devices (up to 480px), the grid shows 1-2 columns with compact spacing and touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px). Tablet screens (768px) display 2-3 columns with optimized spacing, while desktop screens show 4+ columns with full feature sets. I implemented responsive typography that scales appropriately, ensured all interactive elements meet accessibility standards for touch targets, and used flexible image containers that maintain aspect ratios across different screen densities. The variant dropdown and buttons are properly sized for both mouse and touch interactions.
