 Customization

Styling
The component uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:
- Color scheme can be modified in `ProductCard.css`
- Spacing and typography are easily adjustable
- Animation durations and effects can be customized

Data Structure
The component expects product objects with:
javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  image: string,
  price: number,
  originalPrice?: number, // optional
  stock: number, // 0 = out of stock
  category: string
}


Performance Considerations

- Lazy Loading: Images load only when needed
- Optimized Images: Proper sizing and compression
- Efficient Rendering: Minimal re-renders with React best practices
- CSS Optimization: Minimal CSS with efficient selectors

Browser Support

- Modern Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile Browsers: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- CSS Features: Grid, Flexbox, CSS Custom Properties, Transitions

Notes

Layout Approach
The component uses a mobile-first responsive design with CSS Grid for layout. The grid automatically adjusts from 1 column on mobile to 4+ columns on desktop, ensuring optimal viewing across all devices.

Responsiveness Considerations
- Touch Targets: All interactive elements are at least 44px for mobile accessibility
- Typography: Font sizes scale appropriately for different screen sizes
- Spacing: Padding and margins adjust to maintain visual balance
- Images: Maintain aspect ratio while optimizing for different screen densities
